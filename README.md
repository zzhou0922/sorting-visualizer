# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a great project for me. I consolidated the implementation of five vital sorting algorithms and had an opportunity to practice the implementation with React. Throughout the project, I had a deeper understanding of how to use React Hook. 

## Project Purpose

- Produce a sorting visualizer for people who need it to have a better understanding of how each algorithm sort during its process. 
- Gain an opportunity to experience completing a  project from scratch to be fully functional as what I designed. 
- Review bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort concepts.
- Practice the actual implementation of all five algorithms.
- Enhanced the understanding of React.

## Features

- On the home page, have a brief description of five sort algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort, also have a link for each algorithm for more information if the user wants to explore. 
- The flexible data size of the array and delay speed are available to choose from based on user preference.  
- During the sorting animation process, the user can clear anytime and regenerate a new random to play with.
